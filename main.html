            <h2>More Dog Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Dogs have a unique sense of smell.</b> The area of a dog's brain dedicated to detecting smells is about 40 times larger than a human's. This means that dogs can smell things that we can't, and they can even detect scents that are days or even weeks old. This ability is why dogs are often used to sniff out drugs, explosives, and even missing persons.</li>
                <li><b>Dogs can understand human emotions.</b> Studies have shown that dogs can recognize the facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice of humans. They can also distinguish between emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger. This ability allows dogs to provide emotional support to their owners and to bond with them on a deeper level.</li>
                <li><b>Dogs dream.</b> Just like humans, dogs experience REM sleep, the stage of sleep associated with dreaming. Studies have shown that dogs dream about activities that they enjoy, such as playing fetch and chasing squirrels.</li>
                <li><b>Dogs can communicate with each other.</b> Dogs use a variety of vocalizations, body language, and scent cues to communicate with each other. They can use these cues to express their emotions, warn each other of danger, and even coordinate their hunting activities.</li>
                <li><b>Dogs have been domesticated for over 15,000 years.</b> Archaeological evidence suggests that dogs were domesticated from wolves sometime between 15,000 and 40,000 years ago. Over the years, dogs have been bred for a variety of purposes, including companionship, hunting, herding, and guarding.</li>
                <li><b>Dogs have three eyelids.</b> In addition to the upper and lower eyelids, dogs have a third eyelid called the nictitating membrane. This membrane is located in the corner of the eye and is typically closed. The nictitating membrane helps to protect the eye from dust and debris and to keep it moist.</li>
                <li><b>Dogs can sweat through their paws.</b> Dogs don't sweat like humans do, but they do have sweat glands in their paws. These sweat glands help to cool the dog down on hot days.</li>
